            <h2>Online Privacy Policy Only</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for visitors to our website with
                regards to the
                information that they shared and/or collect in Wild Quest (Pvt) Ltd. This policy is not applicable to
                any information collected offline or via channels other than this website.</p>
            <h2>Balance Payment</h2>
            <p>
                Unless instructed otherwise, the balance is payable at least 7 weeks (49 days) prior to departure.
                Certain suppliers (such as SANParks) need to be paid in full 45 days prior to departure.
                Some suppliers request full payment from us 60 days prior to departure,
                in which case you will be asked to pay your balance 65 days before the travel date.
                If you are booking within 7 weeks of departure, the full price will be payable at the time of making
                your booking.
                Failure to pay your balance may result in your booking being cancelled and the first payment forfeited.
                All transaction fees, including wire transfer costs, cash deposit fees, foreign exchange conversion fees
                and bank routing fees are for your account.
                The full quoted amount needs to clear into our account.
                If you pay by credit card, we absorb the credit card fees and no credit card surcharge will be added.
            </p> <br>
            <h2> Cancellation Policy</h2>
            Should you need to cancel your booking or any part of it for any reason (other than COVID-19),
            the following minimum cancellation fees will apply, regardless of the reason for cancellation, subject to
            third party cancellation fees which may be higher:<br><br>
            Cancellation 61 days or more prior to departure - 15% of the full price (half of the 30% first payment)<br>
            Cancellation 60 days to 46 days prior to departure - 30% of the full price<br>
            Cancellation 45 days to 15 days prior to departure – 70% of the full price<br>
            Cancellation 14 days or less prior to departure - 100% of the full price<br>
            <h2>Third party cancellation fees</h2>
            Third parties that we have contracted with, confirmed with or paid already (any lodge, hotel, airline or
            other supplier)
            may have higher cancellation penalties, in which case the third party’s
            cancellation policy will supersede our own and their additional cancellation fee will be added to our own.
